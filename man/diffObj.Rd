\usage{
diffObj(target, current, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{target}{the reference object}

\item{current}{the object being compared to \code{target}}

\item{...}{additional arguments to pass on to \code{print}, \code{str}, etc.}
}
\value{
a \code{\link{Diff}} object; this object has a \code{show}
  method that will display the diff to screen
}
\description{
Compare either the \code{print}ed or \code{str} screen representation of
R objects depending on which is estimated to produce the most useful
diff.  The selection process tries to minimize screen lines while maximizing
differences shown subject to display constraints.  The decision algorithm is
likely to evolve over time, so do not rely on this function making a
a particular selection under specific circumstances.  Instead, use
\code{\link{diffPrint}} or \code{\link{diffStr}} if you require one or the
other output.
