\description{
Implementation of Myer's with linear space refinement originally implemented
by Mike B. Allen as part of \href{libmba}{http://www.ioplex.com/~miallen/libmba/}
version 0.9.1.  This implementation uses the exact same algorithm, except
that the C code is simplified by using fixed size arrays instead of variable
ones for tracking the longest reaching paths and for recording the shortest
edit scripts.  Additionally all error handling and memory allocation calls
have been moved to the internal R functions designed to handle those things.
