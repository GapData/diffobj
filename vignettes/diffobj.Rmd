## Introduction

`diffobj` uses the same comparison mechanism used by `git diff` and `diff` to compare the text representation of R objects.  You are shown what the objects as you are used to see them, with the differences highlighted, instead of possibly cryptic difference messages:

```{r, results="asis"}
library(diffobj)
set.seed(1)
a <- b <- matrix(sample(1:50), 10)
b[sample(1:50, 5)] <- sample(1:50, 5)
diffPrint(a, b, mode="sidebyside")
```

The `diffobj` functions were written originally to compare unit test results and quickly identify the nature of test regressions.  They work best with small objects or objects that are mostly alike, but can be used with other objects too.

## Function Overview

There are a variety of related functions for comparing objects:

* `diff_print`: use the `print`/`show` output
* `diff_str`: use the output of `str`
* `diff_obj`: pick between `print`/`show` and `str` depending on which provides the "best" overview of differences
* `diff_chr`: use the contents of character vectors instead of their display representations
* `diff_deparse`: use the deparsed objects
* `ses`: compute the element by element shortest edit script on two character vectors

## Output

The result of the diff provides the information necessary to transform the
`target` object into the `current` object.  This involves deletions
from and additions to `target`.  The deletions and additions are done
linewise.  Each deleted line will have `- ` prepended to it, and each
added line will have `+ ` prepended to it.  If your terminal supports
ANSI escape sequences the additions and deletions will be color coded.

The first lines of output clarify the coding convention by showing the
`target` object with the deletion symbology, and the `current`
object with the addition symbology.  After these lines you will see the
first and possibly only hunk header.  The format will be `@@ x,y z,w @@`
where `x` and `z` indicate the starting line of the text in
the `target` and `current` objects that is shown after the hunk
header.  `y` and `w` indicate how many lines from each of those
objects are being shown.

In addition to the primary line diff, hunks are themselves word-diffed within
each hunk to help quickly identify small differences.  Just keep in mind that
the `+-` symbols always relate to the original line diff.  The
word-diff is indicated only by the ANSI escape sequence styling and will not
be visible if your terminal does not support them or if you disable them.

The output format used here is loosely based on the `git diff` format.

## Algorithm

The diff algorithm is Myer's solution to the shortest edit script /
longest common sequence problem with the Hirschberg linear space refinement
as described in:
> E. Myers, "An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and Its Variations",
Algorithmica 1, 2 (1986), 251-266.
\url{http://www.cs.arizona.edu/people/gene/PAPERS/diff.ps}

and should be the same algorithm used by GNU diff.  The implementation
used here is an adaptation of Michael B. Allen's diff program from the
[`libmba`](http://www.ioplex.com/~miallen/libmba/dl/libmba-0.9.1.tar.gz) `C` library.

This algorithm scales with the _square_ of the number of differences
between compared objects so is most effective when comparing objects
that are mostly similar.
