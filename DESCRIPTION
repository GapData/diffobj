Title: Compare R Objects with a Text Diff
Description: Compare R objects by computing a `diff` on their text
    representations (e.g. the `print`ed console output). This is similar to
    `tools::Rdiff` except the diff is computed directly on R objects instead of
    text files and does not rely on the system `diff` utility.
