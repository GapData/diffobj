Title: Compare R Objects with a Diff
Description: Diffs provide a clear and intuitive accounting of the differences
    between two objects because they present the objects in usual way except
    modified to highlight the differences.  This package contains a collection
    of functions for carrying out and displaying colorized diffs on R objects
    for display in a terminal or in a browser.  This is inspired by
    `tools::Rdiff`, except the diff is computed directly on R objects instead
    of text files, the diff computation is independent of the system `diff`
    utility, and the diff display is colorized and optimized to handle common R
    objects.
